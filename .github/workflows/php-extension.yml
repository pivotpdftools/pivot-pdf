      # Windows: setup-php may install a patch release whose dev pack is not yet published on
      # windows.php.net. ext-php-rs build.rs calls `php --version` and independently downloads
      # the matching dev pack — if that version is absent, it silently creates an empty php8.lib
      # and linking fails with LNK2019 for every PHP Zend symbol.
      #
      # Fix: bypass setup-php on Windows. Instead, find the latest patch that has BOTH a PHP
      # binary zip AND a dev pack on windows.php.net, then install them together. ext-php-rs
      # detects the installed version and downloads the matching dev pack — which now exists.
